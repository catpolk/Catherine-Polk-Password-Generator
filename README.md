# Password Generator Starter Code

- My motivation was to create a password generator program with four password criteria including numbers, lower case, upper case, and special symbols. On top of that the program should accept ony a specific number of characters (minimum 8 and maximum 128).


- I built this progect to make password creating process for my users sligtly easier, so users do not spend their time thinking about creative and unique passwords to protect their data. The program creates a password for users based on their criteria. 

- This program saves time and helps users create unique paswwords. 

- I leaned many new concepts while working on this challenge. I lesrned how to mannupilate functions, how to use quesrySelect and qyesrySelectAll. I am more confidently using if statements and while/for loops. I uses Math.random, math.ceil and Math.floor. 

- The project stand out becasue it generates the password besed on users preferences and shows what the program created in the text area, if the user doesn't like the password, they can re-generate the password by simply clicking on the "generate password" button.
